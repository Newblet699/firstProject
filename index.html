My dog's name is Riley. Riley loves to be silly, acting like a child and she plays constantly. She will sunbathe when it is hot outside and will snuggle with us in bed when it is cold outside. She might be a bit spoiled but we don't mind. She is very playful and loving with us and she knows plenty of tricks that took as a few months to teach her. She can do all her tricks in one go. She is a bit snippy with an attitude and can coo when she is happy, hungry, sad or silly. We also taught Riley to scratch at the door when she needs to go outside. She is very near and dear to my heart, she is perfect for me and I love her alot.
